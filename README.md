### Table Of Contents

### 1.Project Overview

In this project, you will analyze a dataset related to electric vehicles (EVs). The dataset contains various features such as electric range, energy consumption, price, and other relevant attributes. Your goal is to conduct a thorough analysis to uncover meaningful insights, tell a compelling story, conduct hypothesis testing and provide actionable recommendations based on the data.

### Data Scource

The dataset Scource is "FEV-data-Excel.xlsx".

### Data Overview

1.Car full name: The full name or designation of the vehicle, often combining make, model, and variant.

Make: The brand or manufacturer of the car.

3.Model: The specific model or version of the car.

4.Minimal price (gross) [PLN]: The minimum retail price of the car, in Polish złoty (PLN).

5.Engine power [KM]: The car's engine power, measured in horsepower (KM in Polish).

6.Maximum torque [Nm]: The peak torque the engine can produce, measured in Newton-meters(Nm).

7.Type of brakes: The braking system used, such as disc or drum brakes.

8.Drive type: The drivetrain configuration, like FWD (front-wheel drive), RWD (rear-wheel drive), or AWD (all-wheel drive).

9.Battery capacity [kWh]: Total energy capacity of the car’s battery, measured in kilowatt-hours (kWh).

10.Range (WLTP) [km]: Estimated driving range on a full charge under WLTP standards, in kilometers.

11.Wheelbase [cm]: The distance between the front and rear axles, in centimeters.

12.Length [cm]: The overall length of the car, in centimeters.

13.Width [cm]: The car’s width, in centimeters.

14.Height [cm]: The car’s height, in centimeters.

15.Minimal empty weight [kg]: The car’s minimum weight when empty, measured in kilograms.

16.Permissible gross weight [kg]: Maximum legally allowed weight, including passengers and cargo, in kilograms.

17.Maximum load capacity [kg]: The maximum weight the car can carry, in kilograms.

18.Number of seats: The number of passenger seats in the car.

19.Number of doors: The number of doors on the car.

20.Tire size [in]: The tire size, measured in inches.

21.Maximum speed [kph]: The top speed of the car, in kilometers per hour.

22.Boot capacity (VDA) [l]: Trunk or cargo space capacity, measured in liters according to VDA standards.

23.Acceleration 0-100 kph [s]: Time taken to accelerate from 0 to 100 kilometers per hour, in seconds.

24.Maximum DC charging power [kW]: The highest charging power supported when using a DC fast charger, in kilowatts (kW).

25.Mean - Energy consumption [kWh/100 km]: Average energy consumption per 100 kilometers, in kilowatt-hours (kWh).


### Description:
•	I have analyzed datasets related to electric vehicles (EVs), focusing on uncovering meaningful insights and providing actionable recommendations.

•	Filtered EVs based on budget and range criteria, grouped them by manufacturer, and calculated average battery capacities.

•	To identify patterns, I visualized the relationship between battery capacity and range and detected outliers in energy consumption.

•	Additionally, I developed an EV recommendation system in Python that allows users to input their budget, desired range, and battery capacity to find the best matches. 

•	Using hypothesis testing, I compared the engine power of Tesla and Audi vehicles, drawing insights that informed strategic recommendations.
